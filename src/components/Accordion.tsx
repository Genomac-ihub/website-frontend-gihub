      question: "What is bioinformatics and why is it important?",
      answer:
        "Bioinformatics is the use of computational tools to manage, analyze, and interpret biological data. It's crucial in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a background in biology to study bioinformatics?",
      answer:
        "While a biology background helps, many bioinformaticians come from computer science or math backgrounds and learn the biology along the way."
    },
    {
      question: "Which programming languages are essential for bioinformatics?",
      answer:
        "Python and R are the most widely used languages in bioinformatics. Bash scripting and SQL are also valuable for data processing and querying large datasets."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of datasets do bioinformaticians work with?",
      answer:
        "Common datasets include DNA/RNA sequences, protein structures, gene expression data, and genomic variants, often from sources like NCBI, Ensembl, and TCGA."
    },
    {
      question: "What tools or platforms should I learn?",
      answer:
        "You should get comfortable with tools like BLAST, Bioconductor, Galaxy, and workflow managers like Nextflow or Snakemake. Familiarity with cloud platforms is also beneficial."
    },
    {
      question: "Is machine learning used in bioinformatics?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! Machine learning is used for protein structure prediction, gene expression classification, disease risk prediction, and more."
